# Trichoptera Barcodes
Materials and scripts for ["The Trichoptera barcode initiative: a strategy for generating a species-level tree of life"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0025)

The trees for each clade within Trichoptera can be found [here](subclades/Final_Trees_Subclades). If you want to see the intermediate files, including locality files for each subanalysis, you can look in the [subclades](subclades) folder in this repo.

The files and information needed to reproduce the analysis for the large tree can be found in [big_tree](big_tree). To reproduce this analysis, follow the instructions in [the big tree analysis README](big_tree/Big_Tree_Analysis.md).
